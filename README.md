# homepage
This repository contains the source files of Sijin CHEN's homepage, including `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` and `PHP`(currently unused). Other stuff include the `markdown` and `HTML` notes. 

The url of the homepage is http://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~sjchen0/homepage/home/index.html.

This webpage is touchscreen-friendly without inhibiting the experiences of a desktop/laptop user, thanks to `CSS` control achieved by `jQuery`. 

## opennotes

If deemed appropriate for public access and convenience of personal review, some of my notes will be uploaded to the server. Subject to copyright concerns, however, NO notes taken in lectures offered exclusively by CUHK will be available here. The literature of these notes can incorporate multiple languages, say English and Chinese.
